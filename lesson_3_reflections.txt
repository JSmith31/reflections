When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

I want to use a remote repository when I will work from enother computer.
<<<<<<< HEAD


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

I'd use fork when I want to make local changes, but before I push them to the master repository. Or when I want to make
my own changes from the master repository, but not commit yet.

Clone allows me to save local changes that I can push later.

Branch allows me to make changes as a collabortor.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

I may want to troubleshoot before changing my local master.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

I can make changes offline if I need to.
