When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

I want to use a remote repository when I will work from enother computer.



Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

I'd use fork when I want to make local changes, but before I push them to the master repository. Or when I want to make
my own changes from the master repository, but not commit yet.

Clone allows me to save local changes that I can push later.

Branch allows me to make changes as a collabortor.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

I may want to troubleshoot before changing my local master.



What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

I can make changes offline if I need to.


How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

Everyone make local changes and submit pull requests in the repository. That way conflicts can still be seen, and comments
can be made before a pull request is finalized.
